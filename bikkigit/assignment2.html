    <h2>Keys</h2>
    <h2>Day 4</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><ul><li>Key is a field (or combination of fields) in a table that is used to uniquely identify rows in that table. Keys play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the database.</li></ul> </p>
    <p>Different types of of keys are discussed below</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Super Key</b></li>
        <p>A super key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of one or more columns (attributes) that can uniquely identify a record within a table. Essentially, a super key is any combination of columns that guarantees uniqueness for each row in the table. It can include more attributes than necessary for unique identification.</p>
        <li><b>Candidate Key</b></li>
        <p>A candidate key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a minimal super key, meaning it is a set of one or more columns (attributes) that uniquely identify a record in a table, and no subset of these columns can uniquely identify a record on its own. In other words, a candidate key is a super key without any unnecessary attributes. </p>
        <li><b>Primary Key</b></li>
        <p>A primary key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a special type of key used to uniquely identify each record in a table. It is a fundamental concept for ensuring data integrity, efficient data retrieval, and the establishment of relationships between tables.</p>
        <li><b>Alternate Key</b></li>
        <p>An alternate key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key of a table. Alternate keys are still capable of uniquely identifying records in a table, but they serve as secondary unique identifiers, whereas the primary key is the main unique identifier.</p>
        <li><b>Foreign Key</b></li>
        <p>A foreign key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table. The primary purpose of foreign keys is to ensure referential integrity of the data. In other words, foreign keys enforce a link between the data in two tables.</p>
        <li><b>Composite Key</b></li>
        <p>A composite key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a key that consists of two or more columns (attributes) that together uniquely identify a record in a table. Composite keys are useful in situations where a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify rows within a table.</p>
        <li><b>Artificial Key</b></li>
        <p>An artificial key, also known as a surrogate key, is a type of key used in a Database Management System (DBMS) to uniquely identify each record in a table. Unlike natural keys, which are derived from the actual data and have intrinsic meaning, artificial keys are generated and have no inherent meaning outside of uniquely identifying a record. They are usually numeric or alphanumeric values generated by the system.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Here is an example to know more clearly about keys</p>
    <h3>Example Scenario: Bookstore Database</h3>

    <b>Books</b>
    <table border="2">
        <tr>
            <th>Book id</th> 
            <th>Title</th> 
            <th>GenreID</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>101</td>
            <td>"To Kill a Mockingbird"</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>102</td>
            <td>"1984"</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>103</td>
            <td>"Pride and Prejudice"</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </table><br>

    <b>Authors</b>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Author ID</th> 
            <th>Author Name</th> 
            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>201</td>
            <td>Harper Lee</td>
           
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>202</td>
            <td>George Orwell</td>
            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>203</td>
            <td>Jane Austen</td>
            
        </tr>
    </table>
    <table>

    </table><br>
    <b>Genre</b>
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Genre ID</th> 
        <th>Genre Name</th> 
        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Fiction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Dystopian</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
